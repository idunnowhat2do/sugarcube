# SugarCube v2 Localizations #

This directory contains a collection of localizations for SugarCube's default UI strings.  They are the source from which the packaged versions, available on [SugarCube's website](http://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/#downloads "http://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/#downloads") (under *Downloads > Localizations*), are built.  If you're simply looking for downloads, see the website.

For more information about the guidelines used to create these localizations, see the [*Localization* guide](http://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/docs/localization.html "http://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/docs/localization.html").
